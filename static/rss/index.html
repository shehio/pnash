As I was exiting, I came across a talk organized by researchers from a Montreal-based startup called Maluuba, a then-recent acquisition of Microsoft. The researchers demonstrated how they created an AI agent that had achieved the highest possible score of 999,990 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man">Ms. Pac-Man</a>, the popular arcade game from the 1980s.</p><p>The ambiance of excitement and intrigue left everyone in the room speechless. I felt nostalgic; when I was a little boy, cool kids used to win in video games. Nowadays, cool kids write programs to win the games for them.</p><p>The researchers attributed their then-recent success to Reinforcement learning (RL). I spent the following few days researching the subject matter. I found mesmerizing ideas of which my rapture today has neither waned nor withered.</p><p>In this article, we discuss humanity’s obsession with gameplay problems (be it video games or board games) and why such problems have been unflagging for so long. We briefly mention the niche algorithms, like RL and neural networks (NNs), which have helped to overcome a decades-long impasse.</p><h3 id="games-in-a-nutshell-actions-rewards-and-states">Games in a nutshell: Actions, Rewards, and States</h3><p>See, a game has states, rewards, and actions. A gamer generally performs actions to reach a particular state of the game, and along the way, they accumulate some rewards. The final score is the aggregate of all rewards they were able to collect. A “state-space” is a fancy word to indicate all of the states under a particular state representation.</p><p>A state is a human’s attempt to represent the game at a certain point in time. It’s not an intrinsic property of the game itself. That’s why a game state can represent different things for different people. For video games, a game state can represent the coordinates of the player in the game’s map, along with the coordinates of treasures and adversaries. Other rich state representations for video games render each video frame as a state.</p><p>In Ms. Pac-Man, actions are moving left, right, up, and down. Ms. Pac-Man gets rewards from eating pellets or consuming colored ghosts when he eats a “power pellet.” States represent the position of Ms. Pac-Man, the location and the color of the ghosts at a particular point in time. They also contain information on the current maze shape with the remaining pellets —ones that Ms. Pac-Man hasn’t eaten.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KXUOlwuSMlkP9i7qf_43mz9q3c6fO5PhzPtpawXs5OGquSQNMS-l3H4mXRhn8J7b1CBBtSM7qX0nbf9RQHLAsNbb5S1VU7xMtUXLsZWEL-JJFdcDFDgLprveLJBQAeeokygvxonx" class="kg-image" alt="A Brief History Of Reinforcement Learning In Game Play"><figcaption>Pac-Man. Source: <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/sourceandpixel-516448/">SourceAndPixel</a>, via <a href="https://pixabay.com/">pixabay</a> (CC0)</figcaption></figure><p>A deadly state (that Ms. Pac-Man should avoid) is when a ghost consumes Ms. Pac-Man. A winning state is when Ms. Pac-Man eats all the pellets and finishes the level.</p><p>To give an example from board games, in chess, an action is a move to a piece, be it a knight, a bishop, or any other piece. The state of the game is represented by where all the uncaptured pieces lie on the game board. </p><p>Rewards are a little tricky since, throughout the game, a layman can’t say how consequential a move is on the rest of the game. It takes an expert to determine which moves are strategically superior and which player is more likely to win.</p><p>Now, this was a non-technical introduction for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process">Markov Decision Process (MDP)</a> is. It’s a graph of states connected by transitions that have rewards on them. An action is taken at any state to traverse the graph in a way that maximizes the eventual total reward.</p><h3 id="why-is-gameplay-challenging">Why is gameplay challenging?</h3><p>Programs that achieve high scores and beat humans in games are hard to create. Perhaps this is one reason why gameplay is popular among dopamine-seeking AI researchers. Recently, programs that are good gamers have used RL models and Neural Networks (NN). They use RL models, which have internal MDP representations, to make sense of the world around them. They use NNs to generalize over states that they’ve never encountered from their current “understanding” of the world.</p><p>Now, these RL models are susceptible to some major obstacles like the state representation, the reward architecture problem, and  the computational problem (resources like processing time and memory the AI agents consume). We discuss these obstacles more in the next three sections.</p><h3 id="the-representation-problem-what-should-a-game-state-look-like">The representation problem: What should a game state look like?</h3><p>See, just like a parent raising a child, researchers asserted that they know better than the agents they created. Rather than having the agents discover the world around them like babies, researchers restricted the detail of game states, crafting them only with a subset of information they deemed relevant.</p><p>Richard Sutton, dubbed “father of RL,” shows how this short-term superiority complex has hurt the whole discipline. In his blog “Incomplete Ideas,” he wrote a post titled “<a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">bitter lessons</a>,” where he compares utilizing the human understanding of a game to generic searching and learning, with the latter being tremendously more successful.</p><p>Time and time again, the agents proved researchers wrong. It turns out that researchers had little idea what parts of the game state AI agents considered useful when attempting to win in a game. Previous reductions in the game space have hurt the agents’ efficiency in ways researchers don’t wholly understand. Humans inject their biases when they pick and choose what features to include in a state.</p><h3 id="the-reward-architecture-problem">The reward architecture problem</h3><p>Board games, like chess, don’t come with a score. In chess, for example, the sole purpose is to capture your opponent’s king. One doesn't get partial credit for capturing a bishop or a knight. The question becomes: How do we evaluate a game state when the game doesn’t have an explicit score in non-terminal states?</p><p>A reward function is one that incentivizes an AI agent to prefer one action over other actions. An excellent, yet an unclear incentive, is to win the game. A bad, yet a clear incentive is to capture all of the opponent’s knights. An agent performs best with an incentive that’s clear and effective in both the short-run and the long-run.</p><p>A more intuitive example is that a health-conscious person avoids a delicious cheesecake despite the short-term joy it brings just because of the toll it has on their body in the long-run. Similarly, an AI agent using a “good” reward function avoids some short-term gains (captures) for long-term wins.</p><p>Historically, chess masters created frameworks to reduce the evaluation of a complex strategy to some numerical values according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece_relative_value">relative values of pieces</a>. For instance, according to one of these frameworks, losing a rook for capturing a queen is a straightforward decision.</p><p>However, these frameworks come with a big caveat; they might hurt long-term payoff. For example, capturing a free pawn can give you an advantage (+1) in the short-term but could cost you the lack of a coherent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_structure">pawn structure</a>, the alignment where pawns protect and strengthen one another, that might prove challenging in the end game. Elements like pawn structures, for instance, aren’t easily quantifiable because they rely on the “style” of the player and their perceived usefulness.</p><h3 id="the-computational-problem-how-to-search-in-large-state-spaces">The computational problem: How to search in large state spaces? </h3><p><a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~msn688/breakout_project/">In Atari games, the state space can contain 10^9 to 10^11 states</a>. Meanwhile, a <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1406919/how-many-legal-states-of-chess-exists">game like chess has about 10^46 valid states</a>, whereas a <a href="https://www.i-programmer.info/news/112-theory/9384-number-of-legal-go-positions-finally-worked-out.html">game like Go has 3^361 valid states</a>. To put these numbers in perspective, <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/36302/atoms-in-the-universe/">the number of atoms in the observable universe is 10^82</a>.</p><p>Now, although computers have gotten much faster over time, they’re no match for the two major sub-problems: The exploration of the state space and the training of NNs. The exploration problem is trying to visit as many states as possible so that an  agent can create a more realistic model of the world.</p><p>The training of NNs generalizes the inferences made on the partially observable state-space to the non-observed parts. That is to say, how similar an unvisited state to a visited one. We go into more detail regarding each of the two issues more in the following two sections.</p><h3 id="rl-and-the-exploration-exploitation-tradeoff">RL and the exploration/exploitation tradeoff</h3><p>Throughout life, it’s hard to pinpoint how much one “turn” contributed to one’s contentment and affluence. You can’t tell how much joy a job or a relationship brought compared to another job offer you didn’t accept or a suitor you rejected.</p><p>The same problem persists in games too. It’s hard to precisely identify the contribution of actions in different stages of the game on the final score. The technical term for such a problem is the “credit assignment” problem. RL has been victorious in disentangling actions worth taking in specific game-states. In return, the credit assignment problem has earned RL its well-deserved fame.</p><p>RL models solve the “credit assignment” problem by assigning a credit value to each state. RL works in two interleaving phases — learning and planning. Learning is when the agent is roaming the model to learn about the states. Planning is when the agent assigns credit to every state and determines which actions are better than others.</p><p>Planning and learning are iterative processes. In one iteration, after learning — collecting information about the states, the agent performs planning on the RL model. It constructs transitions from one state to another by choosing one that’s bound to maximize future rewards. In the next iteration of learning,  when prompted with which action to choose for a particular state, it picks the transitions that lead to terminal states with the maximum final score.</p><p>See, only if an agent visits every state, is it able to give states a precise credit value. But as many problems worth solving have incredibly large state spaces, RL agents don’t visit every state. The agent works with only the discovered portion of the world; it approximates the credit for unvisited states based on its “knowledge” of visited states. This approximation requires NNs, which we explain in the next section.</p><p>The credit of one state depends on the following states the agent chooses to visit. Typically, an RL model determines the subsequent state to visit (or the action to choose) using the “exploration/exploitation tradeoff.”</p><p>When you go to a restaurant and order your favorite dish, you’re exploiting a meal that you already know is good. If you explore a new dish, there’s a risk it’s worse than your favorite dish, but at the same time, it might become your new favorite dish. As the adage goes: “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.”</p><p>In gameplay, exploration makes the model probe a much more significant portion of the state space. In contrast, exploitation makes it only probe a limited but promising region of the state-space.</p><p>Now, the state-space search problem is defined by how many states an RL model can visit to make better approximations. The more extensive the region, the exploration covers, the more accurate the credit assignment is, and the more robust the model becomes. Yet, trying many actions for one state increases the computational complexity exponentially.</p><h3 id="what-about-neural-networks">What about Neural Networks?</h3><p>Since an RL model only looks at a subset of the state-space, it can’t say which action will work best for unvisited states. During a run, the agent might hit some states that it has never seen before. It needs a mechanism to capture similar patterns between states of optimal state-space transitions. Although their training can be quite daunting computationally, NNs are an excellent tool for capturing such patterns.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://www.projectnash.com/content/images/2020/05/NNs.png" class="kg-image" alt="A Brief History Of Reinforcement Learning In Game Play"><figcaption>Neural Networks. Courtesy of <a href="https://magedabdelsalam.github.io/">Maged Abdelsalam</a></figcaption></figure><p>See, researchers try to mimic the structure of the human brain, which is incredibly efficient in learning patterns. The human brain, however, <a href="https://human-memory.net/brain-neurons-synapses/">has 86 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory">Hebbian theory</a> attempts to explain the plasticity of the brain: “Neurons that fire together, wire together.”</p><p>Donald Hebb explains that persistence or repetition of activity tends to induce lasting cellular changes. For example, driving becomes second nature to someone after a few years because the pathways, or the synapses for a more rigorous term, involved in driving solidify after a few hundreds activations.</p><p>In gameplay, researchers use NNs that are malleable enough to make sense of all the different patterns in the state space. At the same time, these NN are sufficiently deep (in terms of layers) to learn all the subtle differences between the transitions in the state space.</p><h3 id="rl-changed-video-games-gameplay-forever">RL changed video games gameplay forever</h3><p><a href="https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning">In the early 2010s, a startup out of London by the name of DeepMind employed RL to play Atari games from the 1980s, such as Alien, Breakout, and Pong.</a> This “practical” application caught most of the research community by surprise as at a time, RL was only deemed an academic endeavor. The startup was valued at half a billion dollars and became part of Google. DeepMind’s researchers then published a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236">paper</a> in the popular journal, Nature, about <em>human-level control in Atari games for computers</em>.</p><p>Out of the three problems that we described earlier, videogames suffer from the state-space representation and the intensive computations. To overcome the state representation problem, the researchers passed the raw pixels from the video frames <em>as is</em> to the AI agent.</p><p>To overcome the computational problem, the researchers utilized a few tricks. They reduced the state-space enumerated by applying downsampling techniques and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frameskip">frame-skipping</a> mechanisms. When it came to the NNs, they skipped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization">hyper-parameters tuning</a>. In non-technical words, they used a neural network and not the best neural network.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n4h-hdHM8Hp4dBSbSjmOGl7oXCatvxg7xjdqDvdKmImYaNGiE0Z1naGTNZRuuSN3QMhPLRjHYUHLIRlti4FKPywxZ7mKO1UiP3XY1k-7JF4IcLdp-H4RK5D0hUdq_ltyoCsCLNKr" class="kg-image" alt="A Brief History Of Reinforcement Learning In Game Play"><figcaption>Atari games results.

Although computers were able to beat humans in games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel">checkers in the 1960s</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov">chess in the 1990s</a>, “Chinese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a>” seemed unwavering, researchers deemed winning “Go” the holy grail of AI.<br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PEwJVGSDJaZ7FjzIYd9bV_jlqLiQQMGFNiOCLuAunR4DkUnbyx7unvZC6hq-Z0zfwR34735iLjSHmnZPyiWr6KT3OSfTkOSUeNBviJRDctDkIe_pj69J97qURoAGUOfj0VAHVtpo" class="kg-image" alt="A Brief History Of Reinforcement Learning In Game Play"><figcaption>Go board.

After graduating from Cambridge, he co-founded a videogames company. He then returned to academia and did his Ph.D. in gameplay under the supervision of Richard Sutton.</p><p>In 2016 while working for DeepMind, Silver, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aja_Huang">Aja Huang</a>, created an AI agent, “Alpha Go,” that was given a chance to play against the world’s reigning human champion. 100 million people were watching the game and 30 thousand articles were written about the subject; Silver was confident of his creation. AlphaGo won the match 4-1, a triumph that sparked another wave of excitement regarding RL. The hype over such an AI agent was only befitting. It acquired knowledge about a game that took humans millennia to amass. </p><p>Amongst the problems of gameplay we described above, AI agents that play Go suffer from the computational problem and the reward architecture problem. This time, the researchers only enumerated the most likely subset of state-space using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search">Monte Carlo Tree Search</a> (MCTS), thus cutting back on the computationally demanding requirements. The researchers also leveraged distributed computing with a large number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_processing_unit">TPUs</a>, custom hardware made specifically to train NNs.</p><p>To overcome the reward architecture problem, AlphaGo utilized both model-based learning using MCTS and model-free learning using NNs. The model-free part represents the intuition of the agent, while the model-based represents the long-term thinking.</p><h3 id="alpha-zero-and-learning-all-perfect-information-games">Alpha Zero and learning all perfect information games</h3><p>Silver didn’t stop there; he then created another agent Alpha Zero, yet a more potent agent able to play chess, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi">shogi</a> (Japanese chess), and Go. Alpha Zero utilized more aggressively than any of its predecessors “self-play,” i.e., it teaches itself how to play merely by playing against itself many many times and NOT by studying how professional players play.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/W_vKY5fh2goLXRljbY1QUU6by7v5RzQRXvvXsIHvgWb61-L-KbjA4a9ZFETj0Y6JEn0eSx992FJ6QMqu8yJD88Xb2ECsAz_pE5Vues5dvAvRB7ZY_3BKkwxjET0-NExNGOKXvrNv" class="kg-image" alt="A Brief History Of Reinforcement Learning In Game Play"><figcaption>Shogi.

In shogi, it beat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmo_(shogi_engine)">Elmo</a>, the top shogi program.</p><p>When AlphaZero and AlphaGo went head to head, AlphaZero annihilated AlphaGo 100-0. The difference is simple: AlphaGo was trained on games played by humans, whereas AlphaZero just taught itself how to play. Human knowledge seems to hurt AI agents confirming Sutton’s argument once more.</p><p>That AlphaZero was able to master three different games implies that its dominance would extend to any other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information">perfect information game</a>, one where all information about the game is available to all participants of the game. Chess, shogi, and Go are perfect information games, unlike poker or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_(card_game)">Hanabi</a>, where opponents can’t see each other’s hands.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>The potential of AI is immeasurable and will only continue to flourish through a better understanding of neuroscience and an expansion in computer science. Although we’ve described the gameplay problem in this article, it is not an end in itself. Aside from motivating people, gameplay has provided a perfect test environment to develop AI models, generally because they are hard problems. These same models are being utilized in real-life applications like identifying cancer and self-driving cars as we speak. And this is just the beginning, who knows what the real potential or the different applications that these models would be applicable to in the future!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Only Game in Town: Beyond Central Banks' New Playbook]]></title><description><![CDATA[For over a decade, central banks have kept the markets bullish.

In this post, we discuss the challenges these measures have developed and how to escape from the plateau we find ourselves stranded upon. “The Only Game in Town,” a book by Mohamed El-Erian, provides a guiding framework throughout this post. </p><h3 id="low-growth-is-the-new-normal">Low Growth is the new normal</h3><p>In 2014, <a href="http://twitter.com/lagarde">Christine Lagarde</a>, the chief of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund">international monetary fund</a> at the time, coined the term the “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/christine-lagarde-on-europe-and-the-new-mediocre/72EEB98C-1164-4B7A-8B5A-28A0980ED0F9.html">new mediocre</a>.” This term indicates secular stagnation and low interest rates, euphemisms for negligible inflation and high unemployment.</p><p>Secular stagnation is the condition characterized by persistent negligible growth, where secular is Latin for ‘a lifetime.’ To counter these difficult times, central banks cuts interest rates to stimulate the economy. This cheapens the cost of doing business by encouraging borrowing and investing. Cutting interest rates also derives down Treasury yields, making risk-free bonds look unattractive when compared to risky assets.</p><h3 id="central-banks-and-unchartered-territories">Central banks and unchartered territories</h3><p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/financial-crisis-2008-why-lehman-brothers-what-happened-10-years-anniversary-a8531581.html">Lehman Brothers’ collapse triggered the great recession in 2008</a>. Central banks were given a job they neither asked for nor wanted, to boost the economy artificially. Having no room to maneuver using the set of tools available at the time, America’s central bank, the Fed, crafted a set of new policies. These policies, including “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing">quantitative easing (QE)</a>,” trod into uncharted economic territories. </p><p>Traditionally, the Fed buys treasury notes (see appendix for more info). That is to say; it sponsors only the government’s spending and not that of any other financial entities. In contrast, in QE, the Fed directly injects liquidity into sectors they deem necessary, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_security">mortgage-backed securities (MBS)</a> owners. It bails out financial institutions it considers crucial to the economy as a whole. <a href="http://www.turingfinance.com/computational-model-of-systemic-risk-for-the-banking-industry/">Here’s one model for determining if a financial entity is just “too big to fail” based on graph theory</a>. </p><p>So, <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/aig-bailout-cost-timeline-bonuses-causes-effects-3305693">regardless of the imprudent bets the folks in AIG had made, the Fed salvaged their losses using taxpayers’ money</a>. Ben Bernanke, the chair of the Fed until 2014, explained that these cash injections were necessary to mitigate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_risk">systemic risk</a>, the risk of the collapse of the whole economic system.

It has prevented much suffering and rescued the economy from the verge of collapse. During the recovery, from 2009 to 2016, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/01/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-excerpts-former-federal-reserve-chairman-ben-bernanke-on-cnbcs-squawk-box-today.html">the Fed has created 16M jobs</a>, a number Ben Bernanke usually flaunts. </p><p>The recovery, nonetheless, was flawed because <em>the Fed exposed its playbook to market participants</em>. It gave us a financial market conditioned on continuous Fed support and it increased inequality by the policies it had sponsored.</p><p>As El-Erian puts it, <em>“<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-fed-has-investors-overjoyed-and-its-for-all-the-wrong-reasons/279832/">the Fed is not in the business of surprising the markets</a>.” </em>Regardless of what the news is touting, market participants’ expectations now hinge on the Fed cutting interest rates, boosting the stock market, and saving the day yet again. As good news is good for the market, so is bad news good for the market.</p><p>The Fed is more in the business of suppressing financial volatility. This is highly demonstrated by the interest rate cut last week. Why doesn't it make any sense, you ask? It’s because regardless of how the coronavirus turns out, there will be a loss of economic production for at least weeks to come. The interest rate cut inexplicably only balloons security prices or at least tries.</p><p>Other than conditioning the markets, the recovery was marked by soaring inequality. See, QE targets mortgage-backed securities (MBS), boosting the demand for assets that are disproportionately held by the affluent. In effect, QE has made the rich richer and widened the wealth gap. It’s yet to be seen if QE was worth it in the long run.</p><h3 id="how-long-can-these-policies-last">How long can these policies last?</h3><p>Having normalized the markets, central banks longed to pass the baton to fiscal policy<strong> </strong>since only expansionary fiscal policy<strong> </strong>can induce real economic growth. However, amid dysfunctional politics, public projects (such as infrastructure spending) never materialized, and the private sector never healed. <em>Central banks became the de facto “only game in town” for years to come.</em></p><p>Yet, the longer the game, i.e., central banks experimenting with policy, continues, the riskier it becomes. There’s only so much a central bank can do before its actions are rendered ineffective, and monetary policy becomes enervated. Economists call such a phenomenon a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap">liquidity trap</a>, which is what we’ve seen in countries with persistently low growth like Japan.</p><h3 id="solutions">Solutions</h3><p>El-Erian proposes an alternative playbook to get off the new mediocre:</p><ul><li>Strive for pro-growth measures</li><li>Better the “demand strategy”</li><li>Remove debt overhangs</li><li>Fix the economic architecture </li></ul><h3 id="strive-for-pro-growth-measures">Strive for pro-growth measures</h3><p>Wherever there’s room for fiscal policy, it should be exercised. Examples of fiscal policy include infrastructure spending, ranging from constructing interstate roads and bridges to building hospitals or schools, and corporate tax reform.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/private-equitys-record-cash-pile-comes-with-a-new-set-of-challenges.html">Corporate America possesses more cash than it's ever had in recorded history</a>. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/29/buybacks-companies-increasingly-using-debt-to-repurchase-stocks.html">Companies have been buying back their shares</a> rather than investing in innovation and job creation. At the same time, fewer and fewer companies are paying their fair share of taxes. This has prompted headlines like “<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-paying-zero-taxes-trump-law-155944124.html">60 of the fortune 500 companies are paying zero federal taxes</a>.”</p><p>Bridging the gap between the market’s fundamentals and financial markets is also critical. A financial market should be a mechanism for investors and entrepreneurs to meet. A financial market should not be an end, per se. As El-Erian puts it, <em>“finance provides, it doesn’t create.” </em></p><p>Equity prices should reflect the fundamentals of the companies being traded and not represent speculative bubbles. Today, companies like Uber, Lyft, and Tesla are losing a vast amount of money. These losses don’t comparably affect their stock prices. In economists’ jargon, such discrepancy makes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient market hypothesis</a> obsolete.</p><h3 id="better-the-demand-strategy-">Better the “demand strategy”</h3><p>If you give a wealthy person and a poor person 100 dollars each, the poor person is more likely to spend it than the wealthy person. This is what economists call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_propensity_to_consume">marginal propensity to consume</a>. It states that the poor person has unsatisfied needs, so they tend to spend most of their disposable income.</p><p>See, saving is bad for the economy as a whole. Economists describe this as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift">paradox of saving</a>, which makes the person who saves less affluent in the long run (see appendix).</p><p><em>Matching the ability and the willingness to spend means reforming the tax code. </em>Middle and lower classes should get more tax breaks and subsidies to boost <em>“</em>aggregate demand;” the demand for all goods, which increases the circulation of currency and incentives factories to produce all different products . On the other hand, the better-off don’t need such breaks since they don’t spend as much anyway.</p><p>A terrific example of fiscal stimulus to encourage spending and avert the ripple effect of the global recession is demonstrated by an experiment of the Australian government in 2009. In a stark use of  fiscal policy, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/recession/5341306/Australians-get-900-cheques-from-government-to-boost-spending.html?wgu=272965_16644_15835486713597_1da7408584&amp;wgexpiry=1591324671&amp;WT.mc_id=tmgoff_paff-4551_subsoffers_basic_planit&amp;utm_source=tmgoff&amp;utm_medium=tmgoff_paff-4551&amp;utm_content=subsoffers_basic&amp;utm_campaign=tmgoff_paff-4551_subsoffers_basic_planit">the government handed $900 to anyone earning less than $100, 000</a>. It’s a little more nuanced than that, but that’s okay. </p><p>The government then urged the payees to spend the money on local groceries and businesses to help save their fellow citizens from unemployment. In this <a href="http://andrewleigh.org/pdf/fiscalstimulus.pdf">paper</a>, the author shows that handing people cash was 1.5x to 2x more effective than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Stimulus_Act_of_2008">tax rebates enacted in the U.S</a>.</p><h3 id="remove-debt-overhangs">Remove debt overhangs</h3><p>Regardless if it’s student debts or the whole population of Greece, debt makes entities unattractive to potential investors. Also, having too much debt in the system also lowers the aggregate demand, which causes recessions, job loss, and an unhealthy economic climate. On the other hand, removing debt overhangs betters people’s prospects and bolsters job creation. </p><p>Sometimes, debt is a failure of the system rather than poor planning from the borrowers. Students pursuing their dreams didn’t plan on getting into hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans to get degrees and become qualified. Yet it became more onerous than ever to repay such loans, i<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#4addf23966c1">n the past 30 years, college tuition grew eightfold compared to the increase in wages</a>.</p><p>Although we’ve seen <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/25/782070151/forgiving-student-debt-would-boost-economy">presidential candidates promising forgiving students’ loans</a>, it is still a tough political decision. Many people agonize over the stressful years they went through to pay their debts in full. Now, does it seem fair to forgo someone else’s debt?</p><p>To counter this question, we ask: Would you rather be employed or to see your fellow man failing to pay their debts in full? The answer to such a question is simple; forgiving other peoples’ debt makes all of us better off. In game-theory terms, it’s a win-win situation.</p><h3 id="fix-the-economic-architecture">Fix the economic architecture</h3><p>International collaboration (including the European integration project) is crucial when it comes to universal success. This point becomes difficult to discuss with the rise of protectionism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism">mercantilism</a>, and the anti-immigration sentiment. These trends have given birth to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war">trade war between the two biggest economies in the world</a>, and the divorce between the European Union and its second-biggest economy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit">Brexit</a>.</p><p>Technological changes, free trade, and immigration are a double-edged sword. There’s consensus among economists that these factors improve economic prospects for the whole country. These factors hit different factions of the population differently, nonetheless. For some, they provide prosperity and opportunity, while for others, job loss and despair.</p><p>However, the surplus the country is making from free trade (or immigration) should have a better use than in deep pockets. Such a surplus could be spent on retraining workers and transitioning them into new jobs. However, this entails a journey of support, hampered by house ownership and the difficulty of learning at an older age. How can policy evolve creatively to handle such cases?</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>At the end of the day, El-Erian asserts that nothing is preordained about what we can do. However, whatever we choose to do requires unity, political will, and creative policymaking. In his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment,_Interest_and_Money">General Theory</a>, published in 1936, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes">John Keynes</a>, the renowned economist, wrote: “The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones.” Almost a century has passed since, and it still seems as true as ever.<br><br></p><h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2><h3 id="what-is-the-fed-and-what-do-they-do">What is the Fed, and what do they do?</h3><p>The Federal Reserve is America’s central bank. Its purpose is to stabilize prices (i.e., to keep inflation low) and maximize employment. In the jargonic world, these purposes are called “the dual mandate.”</p><p>The Fed achieves this mandate by controlling the money supply circulating in the system. They have three tools at their disposal: open market operations, setting the fed fund rate, and specifying the reserve requirement for banks.</p><p>The Fed uses open market operations to manipulate the money supply by buying short-term treasury bills (government debt), thus giving the government free money to spend on infrastructure projects.</p><p>They set the Fed Funds Rate (FFR) to shape the risk premium which, in effect, influences the attractiveness of equities. If FFR is high, risk premium is low and people resort to risk-free bonds rather than risky assets such as stocks. On the other hand, a lower FFR means a high risk premium having people invest in risky stocks since they can earn much more money than low-yield bonds. </p><p>The Fed also specifies the reserve requirement for banks, which controls what banks can do with their own money.<br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/97iqi2Viax1XKfm7lddiqVCw7LSL2aRD8Ibb0Wp-kTxd5k_CL0BYmW2qmCGW36-e9gxLMfY-6P9rNkdyUL3BbgC2xUEpgYuG7KgptpMVtgScNluVsfZPseM-_UeckJSjiw5yqxCV" class="kg-image" alt="The Only Game in Town: Beyond Central Banks' New Playbook"><figcaption>The Phillips Curve explains the relationship between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.

This can be explained by the following: If everyone has a tendency to save, then producers have no incentive to produce. Thus they don’t have an incentive to hire workers and they even layoff their current workforce. Since workers don’t have jobs, they don’t have money to spend. As aggregate demand then shrinks, savers lose the opportunity to invest, leaving them with less savings.<br><br><br><br><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Great Gatsby and the Demise of the American Dream]]></title><description><![CDATA[America had long promised the ideals of liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the equality of opportunity.

It’s a tragic story of a self-made man who reinvents himself and achieves socioeconomic mobility, of sorts.</p><p>Gatsby changes his name to conceal the shame of his humble roots. He becomes wealthier than his wildest dreams. Gatsby then moves to Long Island and throws the most lavish parties only to meet Daisy, the love of his life, once again. Although he finds that she got married to another man in his absence, Gatsby is determined to win her back.</p><p>Life can be exceedingly fallacious, you see. It promises so much, but it delivers so little. Heartbreakingly, Gatsby fails to woo frail Daisy. The fact is echoed from Fitzgerald's life to his novel: “Rich girls don’t marry poor boys.”</p><p>The story represents a critique of  the American dream. The idea of working hard and turning one’s life around has lived on, nonetheless. What could be more American, you might think? America has long promised the ideals of liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the equality of opportunity. In this article, we discuss whether she has kept her promises.</p><h3 id="the-american-dream-is-no-longer-american">The American Dream is no longer American</h3><p>In 2012, the council of economic advisors introduced, for lack of a better name, the “Great Gatsby” curve. The curve shows how likely a person living in a particular country is to achieve upward mobility, i.e., to be more affluent than their parents.</p><p>Ironically, America ranks 8th for such a definition of the American dream. Across the pond, however, the Scandinavian nations rank first.

That is to say, the more unequal the distribution of wealth in a country is, the less likely people from this country will be better off than their parents. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation">correlation in such a curve doesn’t imply causation</a>; however, we need more substantial evidence.</p><h3 id="the-price-of-inequality">The Price of Inequality</h3><p>In a remarkable <a href="http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/papers/abs_mobility_paper.pdf">paper</a> from the national bureau of economic research, Chetty et al. quantify the American dream as upward socioeconomic mobility between generations (the same definition from the “Great Gatsby” curve).</p><p>The researchers found that the percentage of the population that achieves such mobility has been steadily declining since the 1940s. The researchers attributed this morose phenomenon to two causes: The rise of inequality and the decline of economic growth. They then went a step further and used <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-counterfactual/">counterfactual analysis</a> to assess the impact of each cause.</p><p>The researchers introduced the term: “mobility gap” to represent the difference between where one “should be” and where they actually are economically. Inequality has a disproportionate effect on this gap. It justifies 71% of the mobility gap, whereas low economic growth only explains 29% of the gap.</p><p>The paper also highlights an astonishing result: At this point, half of the population will be better off than their parents. While the other half will be worse off. That's equivalent to a coin flip.</p><p>If the downward trend continues even further, then most people will make less money than their parents. Such a significant result will end economic progress for most of the population.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://www.projectnash.com/content/images/2020/03/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Great Gatsby and the Demise of the American Dream"><figcaption>The plot represents the percentage of offspring who earned more than their parents on the y-axis and the year the cohort was born in on the x-axis.

The researchers explain such a phenomenon using the asymmetric pay-increase between the CEO of a company and a typical worker.</p><p>Since 1978, CEO compensations have grown 940% while that of an average worker has only risen 12%. Although not everyone is a CEO, the sentiment is there.

While meritocracy promises a level playing field, inequality skews such a field.</p><p>One might ask, is there an inherent conflict between meritocracy and inequality? Meritocracy promises that the best person, in terms of abilities and competencies, beats others in climbing up the ladder. On the other hand, inequality introduces different ladders, each of a different length.</p><p>A good example is that parents could alter meritocratic-based schooling of their children using their ability to pay for private education. A counteraction from the government could be to bridge the gap between public and private schools. As the system evolves, exploitations present themselves to the most affluent. Public policy needs to coevolve to prevent such exploitations and ensure a level field at all times.</p><h3 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h3><p>Regardless of how the novel ends, what made Gatsby greats was his extraordinary gift for hope, and his heightened sensitivity to the promises of life. It is his belief in his abilities and his control to alter destiny. And so, we tread.</p><p>In this article, we’ve outlined how the system has evolved since the 1940s only to show that we’re able to recover what made America America. In the next article, we will discuss low economic growth in more detail and the role inequality plays in it.

When a stunning blonde enters, a colleague of Nash’s cites Adam Smith that every man should pursue his self-interest.</p><p>Nash has an epiphany; he dismisses his colleague’s idea: “<em>Adam Smith was wrong.”</em> He explains, if all boys pursue the blonde, they will block each other, and neither of them will be able to win her.</p><p>When she rejects them all, they won’t be able to pursue any of her girlfriends either because no one likes to be the second choice. Yet, if all the boys pursue the other girls, then each boy will end up having a good time.</p><p>Although I learned later that what Russell Crowe explained in the movie is not Nash Equilibrium, the story inspired me for years to come. The idea that we can all be better off if we coordinated our decision-making has lived on.</p><p>After my undergrad, I spent years educating myself about rationality and decision-making. When I had decided to go back to school to learn more, I ended up studying financial mathematics, economics, and game theory.</p><p>In her book “Grand Pursuit,” Sylvia Nasar writes that a commoner in Victorian England lived the life of a Roman slave. Yet, all this was about to change. In the past hundred years, economists have mastered fiscal and monetary policy. Gibberish as it sounds, this meant we live more prosperous lives than our ancestors.</p><p>I developed a likeness to Macroeconomics because of how influential it seemed to me. How can we pursue full employment and low inflation? What do they have to do with the money supply? I learned about the Keynesian and the Austrian schools of economics and their positions on the government’s involvement in the “markets.”</p><p>In grad school, I worked on financial economics. I dwelled on econometrics and developed “utility-maximization” portfolios. I learned about statistical arbitrage, and I priced financial derivatives based on the Black-Scholes equation. I read about the efficient market hypothesis and how blind-folded monkeys beat hedge funds.</p><p>In my game theory class, I studied interesting problems like residency matching, auction design, gerrymandering, and nuclear warfare models. Aside from these big problems, game theorists model strategic situations. But, what could be more strategic than my social interactions? I went a step further and modeled my life’s interactions as games for which I would find “Nash Equilibria” and “Pareto-optimal” solutions. Maybe more important than all, I learned about “envy-free” cake-cutting algorithms.</p><p>The reason for creating Project Nash is that there are too many beautiful theories in life to let pass by without pondering and commenting on. In this blog I simplify these theories in economics, computer science, and where they intersect. Mainly, I focus on developing an intuition about arcane ideas that are useful in life. Yet, to borrow from the engineering jargon, I do care little about their implementation details. If I’m able to develop the reader’s interest, then they will be able to research the topic in more depth.</p><p>Hollywood’s romanticization aside, the ideas that we’ll discuss will change your life as far as you would allow them. In any case, I do guarantee that these ideas are as compelling as they are transformative of one’s worldview. I only ask for your intellectual curiosity, and I promise it’ll make the ride worthwhile.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
